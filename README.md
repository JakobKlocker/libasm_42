The goal of the project is to create a library of basic functions written in assembly language (specifically, x86-64 assembly) for the Linux operating system. The library should include functions that are commonly found in the C standard library, such as string manipulation functions (e.g., strlen, strcpy, strcmp) and memory allocation functions (e.g., malloc, free).

In addition to implementing these functions in assembly, the project also requires writing a comprehensive test suite to ensure that the functions work correctly under various conditions. The project also requires documenting the functions using a standardized format (similar to the format used in the Unix man pages).

The project aims to deepen the students' understanding of low-level programming and to give them experience with the x86-64 assembly language, which is widely used in systems programming. It also provides an opportunity for students to practice software engineering skills such as documentation, testing, and version control.
